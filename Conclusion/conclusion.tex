This thesis focused in the creation of land cover classification maps and change detection algorithms for vehicles hidden under foliage. 
It was introduced the state of the art methods for the creation of land cover classification maps and change target detection algorithms and it was discussed how these state of the art methods can be improved.

By combining the state of the art methods with textural information it was demonstrated that the overall accuracy of these algorithms can be overall improved, wheter they are 
based in different Machine Learning Algorithms, such as Random Forests or Convolutional Neural Networks.

The usage of these textural information proved that the results can be improved, having achieved an accuracy of over 98\% for the creation of land cover classification maps and of over
97\% for the accuracy of change target detection algorithms. The textural information also proved to be valuable to reduce the overall False Alarm rate of Change Detection algorithms. The proposed Change Detection algorithm showed similar accuracy
when compared to other state of the art methods, but presented significant improvements in terms of FAR, having it decreased almost three times when compared to similar CNN based algorithms.
