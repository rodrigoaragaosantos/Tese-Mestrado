\section{Summary}
In this chapter we will use the textural developed in previous chapters 
to create a change detection algorithm (CDA). The CDA will be assessed
using the CARABAS-II image dataset, which is a set of images acquired by a Very High Frequency (VHF) Ultra Wideband (UWB) SAR system.
The CDA is based on the UNET convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and will use the 
textural information as additional inputs for image classification.
It will be demonstrated that the 
use of textural information can improve the overall performance of the algorithm
in terms of probability of detection and false alarm rate.
